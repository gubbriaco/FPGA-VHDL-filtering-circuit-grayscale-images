**Digital Systems Design 2023 - Master's Degree in Electronic Engineering (specialization: Hardware-Software CoDesign)**
<br><br>
Design of a circuit on FPGA that performs the filtering of an image through an isotropic filter. The circuit is also tested and validated (both from the point of view of the error and from the point of view of the quality of the filtering) through procedures described in MATLAB.
